# Product Context: MonkaMOO

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Traditional programming education often lacks:
- **Collaborative Learning**: Most programming tutorials are solitary experiences
- **Immediate Feedback**: Long feedback loops between writing code and seeing results
- **Safe Experimentation**: Risk-free environment to try new concepts
- **Family Bonding**: Few technical activities that span generations and skill levels

### The Solution
MonkaMOO creates a shared virtual world where family members can:
- **Learn Together**: Explore programming concepts in a collaborative environment
- **See Immediate Results**: Code changes instantly affect the shared world
- **Experiment Safely**: Try new ideas without breaking anything
- **Build Together**: Create objects and rooms that everyone can interact with

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow

#### For New Users
1. **Connect**: Simple login with just a name
2. **Explore**: Navigate through existing rooms and objects
3. **Observe**: Watch other players interact with the world
4. **Communicate**: Use chat, whispers, and emotes to interact
5. **Create**: Start with simple objects and gradually build complexity

#### For Learning Programming
1. **Discover**: Find objects created by others and examine their code
2. **Modify**: Make small changes to existing objects
3. **Create**: Build new objects from scratch
4. **Collaborate**: Work with family members on shared projects
5. **Teach**: Explain concepts to others through the medium of the world

### Core User Journeys

#### Family Collaboration Journey
```
Parent creates a learning room → Child explores the room → 
Child asks questions via chat → Parent explains concepts → 
Child creates their first object → Family celebrates together
```

#### Programming Learning Journey
```
User discovers an interesting object → Examines the code → 
Makes a small modification → Tests the change → 
Creates a similar object → Teaches others how it works
```

#### Multi-Generational Learning Journey
```
Grandparent shares programming wisdom → Parent bridges technical concepts → 
Child brings fresh perspective → All learn from each other's approaches
```
