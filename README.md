MonkaMOO
========

A Python-based learning MOO in the spirit of LambdaMOO.

Goal
----

To create a simple, multi-player, text-based virtual reality, that I can collaborate on with my daughter.

In addition to navigating, extending the world, and communicating with other players, you should be
able to code MOO objects in Python and interact with them in the world.
